Description: |
    mtdev - The mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of
    kernel MT events to the slotted type B protocol. The events put into mtdev
    may be from any MT device, specifically type A without contact tracking,
    type A with contact tracking, or type B with contact tracking. See the
    kernel documentation for further details. The bulk of the mtdev code has
    been out there since 2008, as part of the Multitouch X Driver. With this
    package, finger tracking and seamless MT protocol handling is available
    under a free license.
